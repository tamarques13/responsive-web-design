<p><br>Kurt Cobain (February 20, 1967 â€“ April 5, 1994) was an American rock musician, best known as the lead singer, guitarist, and primary songwriter for the grunge band Nirvana. Born in Aberdeen, Washington, his childhood was happy until his parents' divorce when he was nine, which led to emotional struggles that influenced his music.</br>

<br>In his teens, Cobain moved between relatives' homes, friends' houses, and sometimes slept under bridges. He began using drugs and engaging in petty vandalism, but his musical talent shone early. By the mid-1980s, he played with the local band the Melvins, and in 1985, a homemade tape caught the attention of bassist Krist Novoselic. They formed Nirvana in 1987 and, after several drummer changes, recorded demos and performed locally.</br>

<br>Nirvana's break came when a demo tape reached Sub Pop's Jonathan Poneman, leading to their first single, "Love Buzz," in 1988, and debut album, Bleach, in 1989. Their sound, blending punk rock with pop hooks, drew major label interest. With new drummer Dave Grohl, they released Nevermind (1991), featuring "Smells Like Teen Spirit," achieving mainstream success and global fame.</br>

<br>In 1992, Cobain married Courtney Love, and they had a daughter. Nirvana's final album, In Utero (1993), expressed Cobain's disdain for fame. Cobain struggled with depression and chronic stomach pain, using heroin and painkillers for relief. After a failed suicide attempt in March 1994, Cobain left a rehab center in April and died by suicide at his Seattle home.</br></p>
